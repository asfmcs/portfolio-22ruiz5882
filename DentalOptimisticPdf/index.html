        <h2 id="learned">What I have learned</h2>
        <p>Something I have learned in Computers is how bits<br> work, and how computers are just doing a lot of small,<br> easy, mathematical problems at a really high speed.</p>
        <p>I also learned how there are different ways to<br> represent numbers and values like decimal,<br> hexadecimal, and normal bits.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="learn">What I want to learn</h2>
        <p>I want to learn the next step to coding and making<br> pages like Javascript and just other different ways to<br> make and style pages.</p>
